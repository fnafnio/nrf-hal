# RTIC demo

The Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency (RTIC) framework demo. Many of the demos in this project use RTIC and demonstrate its capabilities in more detail but this is a bare-bones default template for you to build off. RTIC is not unique to the nRF series but very useful for a program that requires concurrency.
